## Highlights
We pay a great deal of attention to motivations for working with and studying evolutionary computing methods. We suggest a division of the sorts of problems that one might wish to tackle with sophisticated search methods into three main classes, and give an example of where EC was successfully applied in each of these. — location: [226](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000S1M41Y&location=226) ^ref-54532

A given environment is filled with a population of individuals that strive for survival and reproduction. The fitness of these individuals - determined by the environment - relates to how well they succeed in achieving their goals, i.e., it represents their chances of survival and multiplying. In the context of a stochastic trial-and-error (also known as generate-and-test) style problem solving process, we have a collection of candidate solutions. Their quality (that is, how well they solve the problem) determines the chance that they will be kept and used as seeds for constructing further candidate solutions (Table 1.1). — location: [235](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000S1M41Y&location=235) ^ref-21628

---
The contemporary terminology denotes the whole field by evolutionary computing, the algorithms involved are termed evolutionary algorithms, and it considers evolutionary programming, evolution strategies, genetic algorithms, and genetic programming as subareas belonging to the corresponding algorithm variants. — location: [250](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000S1M41Y&location=250) ^ref-62375

---
Given an environment that can host only a limited number of individuals, and the basic instinct of individuals to reproduce, selection becomes inevitable if the population size is not to grow exponentially. Natural selection favours those individuals that compete for the given resources most effectively, — location: [272](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000S1M41Y&location=272) ^ref-55060

This phenomenon is also known as survival of the fittest. Competition-based selection is one of the two cornerstones of evolutionary progress. The other primary force identified by Darwin results from phenotypic variations among members of the population. — location: [275](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000S1M41Y&location=275) ^ref-46807

---
Each individual represents a unique combination of phenotypic traits that is evaluated by the environment. If it evaluates favourably, then it is propagated via the individual’s offspring, otherwise it is discarded by dying without offspring. — location: [278](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000S1M41Y&location=278) ^ref-45020

---
small, random variations mutations - in phenotypic traits occur during reproduction from generation to generation. Through these variations, new combinations of traits occur and get evaluated. — location: [280](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000S1M41Y&location=280) ^ref-31178
